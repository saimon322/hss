                As the team physician for the New York Rangers, Dr. Kelly will tell you that his most valuable training was spent learning the field of sports medicine on the sideline at Giants Stadium.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was there that he learned how to get professional athletes back on the field. Itâ€™s the same understanding that he brings to the Rangers, and to every one of the patients he treats outside of professional sports.
